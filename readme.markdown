# ans 1
 we use javascript functions because its a basic building block of code  , it help us to write a code concise , reusable and reuse it miltiple times .
# ans 2
function invocation means a function got executed and its not a function was called by another function and then executed .
# ans 3
Yes functions behave likes a objects in javascript , basically a function are known as first class object .example 
```javascript
function helloworld(){
    console.log("tarun");
};
console.dir(helloworld);
```
when we console.dir we see the key value pair , objects are part of this function therefore when we do 
1. helloworld.length we get 0 .
2. helloworld.name we get "helloworld".
3. when we do helloworld.tostring it gives body of a function in "" quotes . 
* we can assign a variable a value of a function 

# ans 4
Events are basically the thimgs that happen in the system you are programming , which the system tells you about so your code can react to them .
# ans 5 
strings in javascript are primitive data types and strings are immutable , which means the are unchanging .a javascript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
# ans 6
Array are used to store multiple values in a single variable.each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a numeric index , that allows you to access it . Arrays in javascript are dynamic because their size is not predetermined.
# ans 7
The main difference between set and map is that set contains only data elements , and map contains the data in the key-value pair , so map contains key and its value . 
# ans 8
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations . the idea is to store multiple items of the same type together whereas 
the map is an associative container that stores elements in a mapped fashion , each element has a key value and a mapped value . No two mapped values  can have equal key values .
# ans 9
Array methods are functions built-in to javascript that we can apply to our arrays. some of the array methods are :
* concat()
* copywithin()
* filter()
* indexOf()

# ans 10 
we can traverse the array by using different loops and  by directly from the index of an element.
